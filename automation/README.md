# ⚙️ Python Automation Toolkit

Welcome! This guide is for anyone who wants to **use Python to automate boring or repetitive tasks**. Whether you’re a beginner or already know some programming, this roadmap will help you write scripts that save time, reduce errors, and make your daily life easier.

I’m Rodrigo Moreira — Tech Educator and Consultant — and I use automation as part of my classes and mentoring sessions to teach real-world Python in action.
