# 👨‍🏫 Teaching Tech with Purpose

Welcome! This guide is for educators, instructors, and mentors who want to teach technology in a way that is practical, inclusive, and career-driven.

I'm Rodrigo Moreira — Tech Educator and Consultant — and I’ve spent the last 20+ years teaching programming, cybersecurity, data, and automation to students of all ages, from universities to public training programs.

This roadmap isn’t just about **what to teach**, but also **how to teach with impact**.

## 🧭 Principles of Great Tech Education

- ✅ Connect every topic to a real-world application  
- ✅ Build knowledge progressively (from logic to architecture)  
- ✅ Avoid "just code" — explain context and usefulness  
- ✅ Include soft skills: collaboration, critical thinking, curiosity  
- ✅ Respect different paces and learning styles  
- ✅ Never underestimate the power of projects
